For any new stuff to learn the first thing to do a make a clearcut road map,split things and make a good schedule.
I made all required things ! made my roadmap with reffering mutiple resources clubing things up!

So here is my ideal road map
1. *Learn the math for machine learning:*P and S,linear algebra etc.
2. *Learn Python:* Python is a powerful programming language that is commonly used for machine learning.
3. *Learn a machine learning library:* There are many different machine learning libraries available, such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.
4  *Learn machine learning algorithms:* This includes topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees.
5. *Work on projects:* Once you have learned the basics of machine learning, you can start working on projects. This is a great way to apply what you have learned and to build your portfolio.

later I did a little more research on required resources aswell!
I will be pinning up resoureces i am going to use to learn things, later !
